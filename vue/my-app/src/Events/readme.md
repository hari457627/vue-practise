# Guidelines for solving the solution
- create some buttons and display some content on clicking the buttons
- create some forms and use events such as onclick and onchange on forms, display error messages on submit if form fields are empty
- try to implement all possible events in forms
- Implement the css style changes on a sample content, on click of the content change the styles
