# Guidelines for solving the solution
- create mockable apis (post,get,put,delete) from mockable.io.
- Get the data using GET Fetch call from mockable.io and display it in table format
- Dummy json data can also be used for GET call
- Post the data by POST Fetch call using forms to mockable.io
- Maintain Form as separate component and render in home component(maintain different forms)
- create mockable API's from mockable.io for posting the data
