# Guidelines for solving the solution
- create a basic form with three or two fields
- one of the field must be date entered
- use datepicker npm package and integrate it
- write events of form fields in jquery
- after filling the fields, on submit create an alert in jquery. Alert should consist data entered in fields
- on non empty fields submit, display error messages using jquery
