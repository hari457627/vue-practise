# Guidelines for solving the solution
- Declare some  state variables and update those using setState and manipulate the DOM
- Display some values and on clicking on button increase the age
- declare the initial values in state.on clicking the button update the state values
- ex: display name, age, email, phone number. after that display a button, on clicking that button increase the age by 3
